# pystar 
 This is a python GUI app, and some supporting material, to assist with in-game geolocation and navigation.
 
 Rather than using similar tools that rely on using an OM-# as a fiixed starting point, you can enter in 4+ distances to know quantum markers to get an approximate location.  Then you can manually enter in xyz coordiantes and plot a bearing and get an approximate distance.
 
 The real intent of this tool is that if you get lost, or over shoot, or drift off course, you can stop, figure out where you are, and plot a new course.
 
 ## Discalimers
 This tool is a hobby of a hobby.  Real World > playing Star Citizen > building tools for Star Citizen.
